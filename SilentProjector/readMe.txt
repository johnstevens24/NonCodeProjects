Stock projector - 2 fans. Loud and overheats when my heat is on.

MK1- Remove stock fans, replace with 4 50mm fans, each pair sharing the current of one stock fan.
Failure- insufficient cooling, overheated in 15 seconds

MK2- Same setup as MK1, but each fan pair shares current from the 25v led circuit
Success-ish- solved overheating, but is louder than before.

MK3- Same setup as MK2, but inside of a hush box.
Success-ish- still doesn't over heat but still louder than I hoped.

MK4- Added variable resistors in an attempt to quiet fans down to level just sufficient for cooling.
Failure- resistors couldn't handle the voltage from the LED circuit.

MK5- Altered hush box/removed fans cooling led to make room for 120mm AIO water cooler. To cool the LCD I added a 92mm fan blowing air in and a 50mm fan pulling air out. Powered the AIO using resistors and the 12v original fan circuits.
Failure- AIO cooler pump was either off or too loud, no in between.

MK6- Removed AIO liquid cooler and returned to using two 50mm fans to cool the LED. Kept the 92mm/50mm fan setup for cooling the LCD. Altered the hushbox/added a 120mm exhaust fan. Removed speakers from back of projector housing and installed them on the bottom of the hush box (facing users).
Success-ish- Acceptable noise levels, but can still be heard during quiet scenes. Definite improvement over factory setup. Will continue working on it when I have more time.

MK7- *Future* replace all the fans in the system with a total of 4 low decibel 92mm fans.
